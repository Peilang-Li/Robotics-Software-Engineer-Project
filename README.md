## Build My World  
Create a simulation world.
(A strange world without door)
## Go Chase It
Design and build a mobile robot, and house it in the world. Then, program the robot with C++ nodes in ROS to chase white colored balls!
## Where Am I(2019 Version)
Utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.
(I follow the old 2019 udacity lesson here)
## Where Am I(2021 Version)
Utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.
## Map My World
Create a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap from a simulated environment using the previous robot with the RTAB-Map packageã€‚
## Home Service Robot
Simulate a full home service robot capable of navigating to pick up and deliver virtual objects.
