## Build My World  
Create a simulation world.
(A strange world without door)
## Go Chase It
Design and build a mobile robot, and house it in the world. Then, program the robot with C++ nodes in ROS to chase white colored balls!
## Where Am I
Utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.
